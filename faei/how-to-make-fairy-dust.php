This perfume-y rose scented bottle of glittery fairy dust is a great craft to create for your Valentine (or yourself!).  they mostly make them out of twigs and flowers and grass to make them camouflage.  Needs better packaging.  I personally wouldn&#39;t trust buying any online so I make my own.  I haven’t tried regular sized because I was more worried about finger cuts with LO’s smaller fingers. how to make fairy dust</p>
