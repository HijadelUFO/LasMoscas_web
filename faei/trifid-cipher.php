In this way, each ciphertext character depends on two plaintext characters, so the bifid is a digraphic cipher, like the Playfair cipher.  The Trifid Cipher was created in 1902 by Félix Delastelle.  It extends the concept behind the Bifd cipher to a third dimension.  Longer messages are first broken up into blocks of fixed length, called the period, and the above encryption procedure is applied to each block.  The earliest practical digraphic cipher (pairwise substitution), was the so-called Playfair cipher, invented by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1854.
